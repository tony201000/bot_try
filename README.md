Homepage -> Click your bot -> Click `Add friends tool` -> Create friend action barcode (https://manager.line.biz/account/<yourBotId>/gainfriends)

Congratulations on creating your first LINE Bot! Try talking to it and see how it responds!

## ‚õÑ Group and Non-Group

* When chatting with the bot individually, any message will trigger a response.
* In a group, to interact with the bot, you need to use the `@chat` command at the beginning of your message. For example: `@chat hi~`


## üéÉ Special Features

### Horoscope

When your message includes a request for horoscope information, it triggers a web crawler to fetch the weekly horoscope:

* Personal chat: `Give me the Scorpio horoscope`, `I want to know the Scorpio horoscope`, ...
* Group chat: `@chat Give me the Scorpio horoscope`, `@chat I want to know the Scorpio horoscope`, ...

### Online Image Search

When your message includes a request to search for images, it triggers a web crawler to fetch the desired image:

* Personal chat: `Search online for a picture of Lin Xiang smoking`, `Find me a picture of Lin Xiang smoking online`, ...
* Group chat: `@chat Search online for a picture of Lin Xiang smoking`, `@chat Find me a picture of Lin Xiang smoking online`, ...


## üì¢Broadcast Message - Daily Youtube Song Recommendation

* With the `broadcast` API, we can send messages to every user at once using Line Bot
* Here we want the Line Bot to randomly recommend 3 good Youtube songs every morning:
  * Create the data `./data/favorite_videos.json`, you can refer to the author's data

    (The data is created by fetching the author's favorite videos using the `Youtube Data v3 API`, which is not specifically introduced here)

  * Use `./chatgpt_linebot/modules/youtube_recommend.py` to randomly select 3 songs and have GPT organize them
  * Add `/recommend` route in `./chatgpt_linebot/urls.py`:

    ```python
    videos = recommend_videos() # Get 3 songs

    if videos:
        line_bot_api.broadcast(TextSendMessage(text=videos)) # Use broadcast to send messages to users
        
        # Since broadcast cannot send push messages in groups, you can push messages to specified group ids through known group ids
        # You can ignore the code below if you don't need to send messages to specific groups
        known_group_ids = [
            'C6d-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx',
            'Ccc-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx',
            'Cbb-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx',
        ]
        for group_id in known_group_ids:
            line_bot_api.push_message(group_id, TextSendMessage(text=videos))
    ```

    To get the `group_id` of a group, you can test it in the `replit` console using `print`:

    ```python
    elif event.source.type == 'group' and user_message.startswith('@chat'):
        group_id = event.source.group_id
        print(group_id) # Output group_id
        memory.append(group_id, 'user', refine_message.replace('@chat', ''))
        response = chat_completion(group_id, memory)
    ```

  * Now, when we access the `/recommend` route, it will trigger the message broadcast, and all users and specified groups will receive the message
  * Next, we use [cron-job.org](https://cron-job.org/en/) again for scheduling. Set it to call this API every morning at 8:00 to achieve daily push notifications!


## ‚öîAdvanced - Personalized Bot

In addition, we can use the `prompt` method to allow the Line Bot to answer in a personalized way. In `./chatgpt_linebot/prompts/template.py`, we can define a `template`, for example:

<img src="img/2023-10-27-10-09-17.png" width="60%" />

**Question**: What did you have for breakfast today?

**Bot Answer**: Darling, did you wake up this morning? I've been waiting for you in bed, and I'm so hungry just thinking about your body. What should we have for breakfast today? How about a spicy omelette, as hot as your charming figure? üòèüç≥

## Free Deployment Alternatives

Since `replit` no longer supports a free plan, the author provides the following two alternative solutions:

* **render**: The deployment method is similar to `replit`, and will not be extensively discussed here. Although this solution is Serverless, it tends to be unstable.
* **ngrok**: Use your local computer as a server to deploy the API.
  * Download `ngrok` for your operating system.
  * Add the path to `ngrok.exe` to your environment variables.
  * In the Terminal, start FastAPI with:
    `pip install poetry`
    
    `poetry shell`
    
    `poetry install`
    
    `$env:LINE_CHANNEL_SECRET="..."; $env:LINE_CHANNEL_ACCESS_TOKEN="..."; $env:SERPAPI_API_KEY="..."; poetry run python main.py`
  * In the Terminal, run: `ngrok config add-authtoken <token>`, where the token is from your personal account on the [ngrok website](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/get-started/your-authtoken).
  * In the Terminal, execute the following commands to start ngrok:
    ```
    tskill /A ngrok
    ngrok http 8080
    ```
  * Use the Forwarding URL as your Web URL.

    ![ngrok forwarding](img/2024-05-15-14-03-09.png)
    
Finally, remember to replace the obtained URL in the `Webhook URL` section under `Messaging API` in Line Developer.
